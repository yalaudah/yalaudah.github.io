Our SEG 2018 conference paper got featured in a recent Vox media video relating to the role of AI in the oil and gas industry. The paper explores how automatically-generated weak labels can be effectively used to overcome the scarcity of fully annotated training data, and how they can be used to train powerful deep learning models for classifying seismic structures in large seismic volumes.

<hr>
My Ph.D. journey has finally come to an end today. It has been a wonderful journey full of great experiences and many beautiful memories. Any worthwhile journey comes with its challenges of course, and this one is no exception. I'm grateful for my family and friends who were always there for me along the way, and for all my colleagues and friends at Georgia Tech. I'm especially thankful to my Ph.D. advisor, Prof. Ghassan AlRegib, for his mentorship and for making this journey a very rewarding one. I'm proud of what we've achieved, and I'm very excited for what's to come.

I'm really excited to be joining <a href="https://airbusaerial.com/">Airbus Aerial</a> here in Atlanta as a machine learning engineer this summer. Airbus Aerial is a software startup, stationed in the beautiful Ponce City Market pictured above, that is owned by Airbus Defense and Space. The project Iâ€™ll be working on is related to using deep learning on satellite imagery, manned aircraft, and drones to help first responders and insurance companies assess damages after catastrophes such as hurricanes, tornadoes, wild fires, and volcanoes.
