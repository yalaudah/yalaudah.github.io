My research interests are related to image processing, computer vision, and machine learning. I'm especially interested in computational seismic interpretation, image similarity, and problems related to semantic image segmentation and scene labeling. I breifly introduce each of these topics below:

<h3> Image Similarity </h3> 

Image similarity can be generally defined as the problem where given a set of two images or more, we would like to quantify how similar or dissimilar these images are to each other. Usually similarity in this context is not defined in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE) or Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) for <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4775883&newsearch=true&queryText=Mean%20Squared%20Error:%20Love%20It%20or%20Leave%20It%3F"> very good reasons </a>. Therefore it becomes important to develop (or learn) features that can accurately represent the content of visual data. These features should also be robust to noise, translation and rotation, geometric distortions, or whatever the application might require. Image similarity has a wide range of applications, from image quality and feature ranking, to image and multimedia retreival.

Our work in computational seismic interpretation is mainly concerned with developing computational methods and algorithms to help seismic interpreters and geophysicists process and understand seismic data more efficiently. I've mainly worked on developing new seismic attributes, detection and delineation of subsurface structures, developing expressive descriptors for seismic data, and using these descriptors to detect and classify certain structures in seismic volumes.

<h3> Semantic Segmentation and Scene Labeling </h3>

An important step towards image understanding (with its widely useful applicaitons) is scene labeling (sometimes referred to as <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4038">"semantic segmentation"</a>, or <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4101">"scene parsing"</a>). Scene labeling is the task of assigning every pixel in an image with a label describing the category to which the pixel belongs. Scene labeling has many exciting applications, one of which is enabling autonomous vehicles as the image above might hint.
