I'm very excited to join [Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs (MERL)](http://www.merl.com/) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as a research intern this summer. MERL is a world-class research center with over 50 researchers who conduct basic and applied research in areas ranging from communications and electronics to signal processing and machine learning. I will be working on a research project related to [computer vision](http://www.merl.com/research/computer-vision#news) and machine learning. I'm looking forward towards an exciting few months.
