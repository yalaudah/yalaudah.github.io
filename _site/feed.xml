        <title>Hello World!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello world, I have a confession. Iâ€™ve been trying to start a blog for some time now. I started my first blog back in 2007 and  after writing a few posts, my enthusiasm faded away quickly. I donâ€™t want that to happen again, so Iâ€™m mainly writing this post to shame my future self into keeping the habit, and writing more. ðŸ˜‰&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™ll be mainly writing about technical ideas that Iâ€™m interested in, conferences that I attend, and books that I read. Iâ€™ll admit I am mostly doing this for selfish reasons. In part to get into the habit of writing, and explaining technical ideas clearly, but also to give me an opportunity to rethink and understand different topics in a better way. I really believe that the best way to fully understand something is to attempt to teach it to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope in the coming days and weeks you would find something useful here. I learn a lot from your feedback so please feel free to comment down below.&lt;/p&gt;
