<p>I’m very excited to join <a href="http://www.merl.com/">Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs (MERL)</a> in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as a research intern this summer. MERL is a world-class research center that conducts basic and applied research in areas ranging from communications and electronics to signal processing and machine learning. I will be working on a project related to <a href="http://www.merl.com/research/computer-vision#news">computer vision</a>. I’m looking forward towards an exciting and productive summer.</p>
