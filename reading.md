<h1 class="pageTitle">Reading</h1>

I like to read (or <a href="http://www.audible.com/">listen</a>) to books whenever I have some free time. Here are some of the books that I've been reading lately: 

<style type="text/css" media="screen">
        .gr_grid_container {
          /* customize grid container div here. eg: width: 500px; */
        }

        .gr_grid_book_container {
          /* customize book cover container div here */
          float: left;
          width: 98px;
          height: 160px;
          padding: 2px 2px;
          overflow: hidden;
        }
</style>
