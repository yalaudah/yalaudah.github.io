<p>
I'm an applied data scientist and machine learning engineer, currently working at Microsoft. I hold a Ph.D. in Electrical & Computer Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology. My doctoral research focused on developing machine learning algorithms for environments low on annotated data, particularly within the energy domain. Professionally, my passions lie in cloud computing, data science, machine learning, and software engineering. With over 5 years of industry experience, I've tackled a broad array of challenges across multiple technical and industry domains. One of my guiding principles is not only the effective application of machine learning for real-world impact but also a strong commitment to software engineering best practices and collaborative teamwork. Leading technical teams has also been a rewarding part of my journey, where I prioritize both the project's success and the ongoing growth of team members.
